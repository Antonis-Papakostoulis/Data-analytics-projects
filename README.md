## About

Hello, my name is Antonios Papakostoulis and I'm a Btech Graduate from Ionian University with experience in data management and analysis. Even though my studies are not solely based on data analytics, a big portion of my studies focused on how data can be used to help a company solve its problems and prosper. After I graduated i focused on making my skills as an analyst better and also tried to acquire knowledge thats necessary for any future data analyst. With great knowledge of MS Excel and MS Power BI and a good foundation in SQL and Python I'm positive i can make a positive impact on your company.
